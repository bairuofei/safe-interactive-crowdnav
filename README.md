# Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation

> Forked from [this repo ](https://github.com/sepsamavi/safe-interactive-crowdnav)

This repository contains the code for our paper **SICNav: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation using Model Predictive Control and Bilevel Optimization** including the CrowdSimPlus Simulator.

## Setup
In a conda environment with Python 3.8.13,

1. Install this package using pip:
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ````
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ````
3. Clone and install [Python-RVO2](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/Python-RVO2) library. Note that a compatible version of Cython `0.29.33` will be installed already in step 2. You should only need to run:
    ```
    pip install -e <path-to-Python-RVO2-dir>/Python-RVO2/
    ```

4. (Recommended) Install HSL to use advanced solvers in IPOPT, the settings that we use in `campc.py` make use of a linear solver from HSL, however the code in this repo will work with the default IPOPT settings as well. Instructions: https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/Obtaining-HSL.

## Testing Crowd Navigation Algorithms

The following algorithms can be visualized by running the following command in the `sicnav/` directory:
```
python simple_test.py --policy <policy>
```

- Collision Avoidance MPC (`--policy campc`) can be configured in `sicnav/configs/policy.config` to act as the following algorithms described in the paper:
    - **SICNav-p (ours)**: our algorithm with access to privileged information about the humans
    - **SICNav-np (ours)**: our algorithm without access to privileged information about the humans
    - **MPC-CVMM**: the MPC baseline that does not model human interactively

- Dynamic Window Approach (`--policy dwa`)

To train and visualize the Reinforcement Learning algorithms, **SARL** and **RGL**, please see the `RL_nav/` subdirectory.

## CrowdSimPlus Simulator

CrowdSimPlus is based on OpenAI gym and is an extension of CrowdSim ([Repo](https://github.com/vita-epfl/CrowdNav), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08835)), with the follwing added features:
- Static obstacles to allow for more realistic dense scenarios.
- Social Forces Model (SFM) policy to simulate human agents, in addition to the original Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) policy. These policies can be found under `crowd_sim_plus.envs.policy`.
- [Stable Baselines 3 (SB3)](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) integration for Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods.
